My name is Kris McCarty and I am a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Psychology at Northumbria University in Newcastle Upon-Tyne, UK.

My research broadly encomapsses perceptions of human movment, or in other words, Body Language. I primarilty approach these questions from an evolutionary perspective. I am also involved in the Aerospace Medicine Research Group at Northumbria, mostly providing my technical expertese in motion capture.
